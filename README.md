## üîß Module Functionality

### üîó Interaction with Other Modules

The module operates as an independent microservice, orchestrated within a microservices-based architecture and exposed through an **API Gateway** that handles authentication and request routing.

#### üîÑ General Interaction Flow:

1. **Cliente (Web/M√≥vil)**: Sends medical appointment requests to the **API Gateway**.
2. **API Gateway**:
    - Retrieves a JWT token from the **Auth Service**.
    - Validates the token and routes the request to the corresponding microservice.
3. **Medical Shifts Service**:
    - Verifies the user and their roles through the **Users Service**.
4. **Estadistics Service**:
    - Consumes the generated events to create historical reports and care statistics.

- [ ] Class Diagram

![Class Diagram](<assets/imgs/diagrams/class.png>)

The class diagram represents the main entities involved in shift management in the context of university welfare.
Each class encapsulates specific attributes and relationships to reflect the behavior and structure of the system.

### Main Classes

### `User`

- Represents the users who can request appointments.
- **Attributes**: `id`, `name`, `role`**Relationships**: It has a relationship with the `Turn` class as a patient.

### `Turn`

- Contains information on assigned or requested shifts.
- **Attributes**: `id`, `code`, `date`, `levelAttention`, `priority`, `speciality`, `status`, `dateAttention`
- **Relationships**:
  - A `User` who requests the turn.

### `UniversityWelfare`

- Contains settings related to shift availability.
- **Attributes**: `id`, `disableTurns`
- **Relationships**: It has a relationship with the `DisableTurnsBySpeciality` class.

### `DisableTurnsBySpeciality`
- Contains settings related to shift availability by specialty.
- **Attributes**: `speciality`
- **Relationships**: It has a relationship with the `UniversityWelfare` class.

### `Multimedia`

- Manages informative content related to the service.
- **Attributes**: `id`, `name`, `type`, `url`, `duration`

- [ ] Component Diagram

![Component Diagram](<assets/imgs/diagrams/components.png>)

The following component diagram demonstrates the complete flow and functional structure of the *MedicalTurns* system, covering everything from the user interface to integration with external services.

- [ ] Connection with statistics service

![Statistics service](<assets/imgs/diagrams/bismuto_statics_service.png>)

The raw data is sent and returned processed.

- [ ] Connection with auth service

![Auth service](<assets/imgs/diagrams/auth_service.png>)

Generates the token which will be used by our module for its validation and management of permissions by role

### Main Components

### `UniversityWelfareService`

- It is responsible for managing shifts, including their creation and updating.

### `ReportService`

- Collects and sends the data necessary for statistical analysis.
- This information is processed by the external service `bismuth-statistics-service`, which generates the statistics
when requested.

### `MultimediaService`

- Manages the module's multimedia elements, such as images and videos.
- Relies on the `MultimediaController` to expose these resources through the API.

- [ ] Sequence Diagram

[Sequence Diagram](<assets/docs/Sequence-Diagrams.pdf>)

This section documents the various **sequence diagrams** that describe the interaction between system components over time, specifically in the key flows defined for each functional module. These diagrams are essential for visualizing how the various services, controllers, and entities collaborate to fulfill the defined use cases.

### Organization of Diagrams

Sequence diagrams are organized in folders under the `sequence-diagrams` directory, according to the functional and technical modules of the system. The structure follows the **layered architecture** pattern:

- `controller/`: Contains diagrams focused on interactions at the API and HTTP controller levels.
- `service/`: Contains diagrams detailing the business logic and how the system's internal services manage processes.

Each subfolder within `controller` and `service` corresponds to a specific module of the system:

- `multimedia-controller` and `multimedia-service`
They document the workflows related to uploading, querying, and validating multimedia files associated with medical appointments or users.

- `report-controller`
Contains diagrams representing the communication between the main system and the external statistics and reporting module, as well as the display of that data to the user.

- `university-welfare-controller` and `university-welfare-service`
Represent operations related to university welfare, including social assistance flows or student tracking.

- `turn-service`
Includes diagrams for managing medical shifts, such as assignment, completion (due to attendance or non-attendance), and availability queries.

---

These diagrams provide a clear understanding of system behavior at runtime and are a useful tool for both developers and functional analysts.

- [ ] Data Diagram

![Data Diagram](<assets/imgs/diagrams/data.png>)

The system uses a relational database (**PostgreSQL**) whose model represents the key entities involved in shift management within the context of university wellness.

The main tables and their purposes are described below:

### `app_user`

Represents the system's users (such as students or administrative staff).
Although the overall system has a centralized authentication module, this microservice stores the `app_user` table locally to avoid direct dependencies, ensuring the service's autonomy and resilience, in accordance with microservices design principles.

### `turn`

Records appointments requested by users, including attributes such as:

- Code
- Date
- Date attention
- Level attention
- Priority
- Specialty
- Status

Each shift is associated with a user.

### `university_welfare`

Defines the general settings for the university wellness service, including whether *shifts are enabled or disabled*.

### `disable_turns_speciality`

Relates specialties to wellness services that have **disabled shifts**.
This table allows you to represent multiple disabled specialties per wellness instance, addressing the
limitation of relational databases regarding list storage.

### `multimedia`

Stores informative content such as **videos or images** related to the service. It includes attributes such as:

- Duration
- Name
- Type
- URL

### `speciality_sequence`

It maintains **sequential numbering by specialty**, allowing you to assign a shift number sorted by type of medical care.

## üß™ Evidence of Tests

- Evidence of coverage:

As part of software quality assurance, automated tests were performed to validate the correct functioning of the developed components. To measure the scope of these tests, JaCoCo (Java Code Coverage) was used, a tool that analyzes the percentage of source code executed during test execution.

Additionally, SonarQube was integrated to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the code's status, including coverage metrics, technical debt, code duplication, and compliance with best practices. Thanks to these tools, test coverage of over 90% was maintained, indicating a high level of automated validation of the system's code.

This level of coverage not only reflects an effort to ensure software reliability but also facilitates future project maintenance by reducing the likelihood of errors in already implemented features.
